# ITAPI3 - Managed TAPI 3.0 .NET wrapper

This C++/CLI library is for applications that want to access TAPI 3.x functions.  The existing .NET RCW cannot be used with TAPI 3.0 due to some issues in the TAPI 3.0 COM library.  

This wrapper works around those issues and provides a proper wrapped implementation.

If you are interested in using TAPI 2.0, then check out [ATAPI](https://github.com/markjulmar/atapi/)instead.
